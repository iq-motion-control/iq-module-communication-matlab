% StoppingHandlerClient A Vertiq module is considered stopped when it has been below its stopping speed continuously for some stopping time. 
% Anytime the moduleâ€™s velocity goes above the stopping speed, it will reset the countdown on the stopping time.
%
% Example:
%   % Make a communication interface object
%   com = MessageInterface('COM18', 115200);
%   % Make a Stopping Handler object with obj_id 0
%   % Stopping Handler objects are always obj_id 0
%   stoppingHandler = StoppingHandlerClient('com', com);
%   % Use the Stopping Handler object
%   stoppedSpeed = stoppingHandler.get('stopped_speed');
